# Holonic Models 
## Origin, Etymology, and Definition of Holons and Holarchs
- Origin: Was used by Arthur Koestler in his book The Ghost in the Machine (1967)
- Etymology:  h√≥lon is a Greek translation from the Latin word universum, in the sense of totality. holarch incorporates the Greek "arch" which means rule, so holarch translates to "rules between senses of totality".
- Definition: A holon is a self-stable unit of being that is simultanously whole and part. Holarchs are simply holons when viewed from the focal point of the interconnections (interfaces) between the sub holon parts. In computing terms a holons would be defined by classes and holarchs by interfaces.
## Examples of Holons and Holarchs in Biology
- Ant hills are both a composition of ants and a singular organism.
- Pando, is both the worlds largest organis (located in Fishlake National Park in Utah) and a simple collection Aspen treens.
- Eukaryotes have 2 unique sets of DNA (mitochondrial and native)
- My cells are constantly being replaced, yet I still exist
